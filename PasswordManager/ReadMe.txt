#Password Manager
This is a password Manager. Its useful for managing passwords.

##Getting Started
Just download the file and run on your IDE

###How it works
The program is very simple. There is a String with a list of characters and special characters. The user enters in how long of a 
password they want. The program has a loop that loops through and generates a random number for every character long the user wishes 
the password to be. The random number generated and is used to find that specific character in the character list and concatenates 
it to the Password String. Finally the Password is printed out.

The program connects to a database and stores the usersname and passwords that you enter into it. The search tab will find the password 
for the username entered into it.
